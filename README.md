# Plasma physics in Julia

Programming exercises in Julia for "Introduction to Plasma Physics" at Masaryk university.

This repository is organized by mirroring Interactive Introduction to Plasma Physics. Part II: Hands-on exercises. You are encouraged to take a look at the original material to look for physical insight, context and pretty pictures. The code there is written in MATLAB. In this repository, you will find the code (in Julia) needed to complete the exercises.

Easiest way to get Julia is to install from binary files from the official [website](https://julialang.org/downloads/).
Another option is to build Julia from source, follow the instructions at the [github pages](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia).
